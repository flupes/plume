We finally cut the tie with our marina in Alameda on Halloween day, October 31!

**Our plan: Sail PLUME, our Norsea 27, south along the Pacific West coast. Starting in the US from Alameda to San Diego, we&#8217;ll continue along the Mexican coast. There we&#8217;ll sail down the Baja Peninsula and then explore the Sea of Cortez and/or the Mexican mainland coast.**

Our first anchorage was Richardson Bay (Sausalito) where we experienced gale force winds and heavy rain for two nights. But our anchor hold very well in these gusty winds. We had then one day with a little bit of sunshine before another gale and&#8230; a nice dinner on Oberon, our friends&#8217; 40ft sloop bound to French Polynesia.

We finally set sail for Monterey, and passed under the Golden Gate Bridge (Youhouou!) on November 6. The first night at sea with Kenzo was cold, windy and foggy&#8230; But Kenzo enjoyed the experience of sleeping and living at sea and arrived all rested after a good night sleep! The bad news however was that we discovered a leak at the thru-hull of the exhaust system&#8230;
