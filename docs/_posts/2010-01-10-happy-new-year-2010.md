We spent a cold but wonderful new year eve in a campground at Joshua Tree
National Park. We slept 3 nights under our small tent next to our new trailer.
Kenzo had his first real rock climbing introduction on the colored granite: who
could dream of a better place to inaugurate a new pair of climbing shoes and
harness!
