After some stops in Phoenix and Tucson (delightfully hosted by some friends who are/were Norsea owners) we finally crossed the border January 6th. It took us 2 hours and several hundred pesos to declare some items (for whose who know, we got a &#8220;green&#8221; light)Â and get new visas. Pretty good for a first passage, but it delayed us enough that we arrived by night at San Carlos. But we had a night booked at Adlai and we grabbed a nice dinner at Rosa&#8217;s Cantina.

The next morning we discovered Plume at the boat yard with our own eyes for the first time after 5 months and one hurricane. Everything was impregnated with dust, but we found no serious damage.

From there, the hard days to convert Plune-storage to Plume-sailboat started. The boat had been totally reorganized to sustain the summer heat with almost all the gear stored inside. It is an interesting puzzle to restore the boat to a livable space. The first effort was put on the aft cabin, thus Kenzo recovered his own area with his toys and books! Now he does not want to leave Plume to go back to the hotel!
