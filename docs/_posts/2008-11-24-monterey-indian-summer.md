We spent 4 days in Monterey fixing the leak at the exhaust system
thru-hull, and testing Plume in the Bay. We also enjoyed the visit of several
friends and had incredibly good weather: the &#8220;Monterey Indian
Summer&#8221;.
  
Well, we start to love this little city of fishermen, with everyday fresh fish
at $1 per pound on the wharf, beaches for Kenzo and a delicious french bakery!
However we are now ready to move on and wait for a weather window to sail south
again. But this window is slow to come!
