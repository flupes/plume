Plume (Web)**Log** is born.

We will be logging here both the technical aspects of Plume and her cruising adventures. This site is mostly for ourselves and our close friends, but it is open to anyone who shares our love of sailing and of the Norsea 27!

We moved to a blog rather than standard website for both the ease of update and the &#8220;temporal&#8221; aspect of our log. Our [&#8220;classic&#8221; web site](http://plume.flupes.org) is still accessible.

This log is coupled with a Photo-Blog accessible on the right side bar [Photo Gallery](http://plume.flupes.org/gallery) (sail or technical).

We hope to be able to update this site frequently!

_CÃ©cile & Lorenzo & Kenzo_
