It took us 8 long days to move our small 2 bedroom house into a 8ft x 16ft x 8ft container&#8230; This was hard work since we did not realize how much has been accumulated during the 5 years we rented our lovely home. The trucker who came pick up our Portable On Demand Storage (PODS) asked what we had put inside: we were grossly overweight! Here is how we did it: [pods-filling](/assets/2008/09/pods-filling.mov) 😉 

Thanks to all of you who helped moving furnitures, cleaning, babysitting, cooking and more!
