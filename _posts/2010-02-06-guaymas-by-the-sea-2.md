Last week we did a small see trial outside San Carlos. We had serious wind and confused seas that put Plume and the crew to the test. As usual Plume sailed fine. The crew however needed better sea legs ðŸ˜‰ We spent the 2 following days at anchor inside the San Carlos Bay. The first night we had a serious thunderstorm with very gusty winds and lightning for several hours. Good test for the anchoring system and to evaluate how quickly we can disconnect our antennas.

After a good day resting at the anchorage and visiting the nearby beach, we finally took off for the large bay of Guaymas. This was a very welcome change for us because we were tired of San Carlos, sounding too much like work&#8230;  
In addition, Guaymas from the sea is much more beautiful than from land!

We still had our car because we were waiting for a package in San Carlos. But we could see that we did the switch from land to sea: the car that was a nice convenience while working on the boat, suddenly became an annoyance (we had to pick it up by bus, park it, etc.).

After a week, we have finished our last projects, received our package, filled Plume with food, put the car in storage, and enjoyed pre-carnival atmosphere: we are ready to go south!
